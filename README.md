# Cisco Packet Tracer Network Simulation Project

This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project simulating a complex network topology. The project includes various networking components and configurations to demonstrate the setup of a detailed and functional network environment.

## Project Overview

The network simulation includes multiple routers(wired, wireless), switches, Servers(DHCP,DNS,Mail,Web), PCs, and other networking devices. The setup is designed to showcase the implementation of different networking protocols and technologies such as RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, EtherChannel, HSRP, and more. 

## Network Topology

## Configuration Details

The following configurations have been implemented in the network topology:

- **Routing Protocols**: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP
- **Switching Technologies**: EtherChannel, HSRP
- **Access Control**: VLAN configurations, SSH access
- **IP Addressing**: Static and dynamic IP addressing (DHCP)
- **Bandwidth and Delay**: Adjusted for different network scenarios
- **Network Services**: DNS, Web, Email, and Smart Phone configurations

## Detailed Implementation Instructions

### Key Points Covered in the Configuration Guide

1. **Device Initialization**:
    - Assigning IP addresses to routers and PCs.
    - Setting up VLANs for segmented network traffic.
2. **Protocol Configuration**:
    - Configuring RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP for dynamic routing.
    - Implementing EtherChannel for link aggregation.
3. **Access and Security**:
    - Setting up SSH for secure remote access.
    - Limiting the SSH acces only for one device (Mother of Net Admin)
    - Configuring HSRP for high availability.
    - Impleminting securitt good pracites like switches Black Hole VLans
4. **Network Services**:
    - DNS and DHCP configuration.
    - Web and email server setups.
    - Smart Phone integration within the network.
5. **Performance Tuning**:
    - Adjusting bandwidth and delay settings for different network segments.
